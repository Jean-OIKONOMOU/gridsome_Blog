This is the project you get when you run `gridsome create new-project`.

### 1. Install Gridsome CLI tool if you don't have

`npm install --global @gridsome/cli`

### 2. Create a Gridsome project

2. `cd my-gridsome-site` to open the folder
3. `gridsome develop` to start a local dev server at `http://localhost:8080`
4. Happy coding 🎉🙌

# BE CAREFUL -> tailwindCSS changed the way it interacts with Gridsome. Also, Yarn has a lot of problems with gridsome, it's better to use NPM for everything.
